Polymorphism Means Many Forms

with the Same Function we  can do different Thing based on the situation


its allows us to create consistent code

its Can be done Through :

1-Function Overriding 
2-Function Overloading
3-Virtual Function

4-Operator Overriding :
For Instance:
int a=10;
int b=20;
string S1="Mohamed";
string S2="Mustafa";

when you Write a + b  The Compiler Will Sum a With b


and when you Write S1 + S2 The Compiler Will concatenate the First String with The Other One
