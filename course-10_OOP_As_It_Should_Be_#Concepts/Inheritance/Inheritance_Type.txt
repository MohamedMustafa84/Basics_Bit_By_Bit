Inheritance Type 

1-single Inheritance :
 when One class inherit the other one 
 for instance : 
 class B inherit Class A 


 2- Multi Level Inheritance :

 for example :
 class B inherit Class A  and class C inherit class B 

3-Hierarchical Inheritance:

example:
 
 when class A inherited By B ,C,D,example

                            A
    ________________________|____________________
    |           |           |            |       |
    B           C           D            E       F


4-Multiple Inheritance:
when One class inherit Two Class 

Note : this type of Inheritance is not supported at the New Programming languages  Coz it make the code complex .

            A                B

                    |
                    C



5-Hybrid Inheritance :

it More complex than Multiple Inheritance And Also Not supported At The New Programming Language For the Same reason

One Class Inherited By Two Classes And this Two Classes Inherited By One Calss
