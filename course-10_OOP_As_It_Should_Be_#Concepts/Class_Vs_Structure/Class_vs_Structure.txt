   |  structure                    |          class                            |
 1 |keyword :struct                |  keyword :class                           |
 2 | Default :Public               |  Default :Private                         |
 3 | Purpose : grouping Data       | data abstraction and inheritance and More |
 4 | value type store in the stack | Reference type store in the heap          |
 5 | use for small thing           | for big size                              |
 6 | Only parametrize constructor  |  all type of constructor                  |

 Note : the structure can hold a method put it not preferred to use it for that 
 if you have small data use the structure and if this data contain one method then you should use the class 
 to take his benefits.
