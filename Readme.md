This repository contains my practical solutions  from the **Programming Advices** path by Dr. Mohamed Abu-Hadhoud.  
Each folder represents the contents of one course.

## Contents


- Course03: C++ Level One
  it covers the fundamentals of C++ programming, such as variables, functions, loops, and more.

- Course04: Problem solving Level One
  It includes fifty problems of increasing difficulty designed to develop the problem-solving skills      and help me  apply what you learned in the third course.
  
- Course05: Problem solving Level Two with three Projects
    the course provides another set of fifty progressively challenging problems, focusing on writing        clean code and applying the divide and conquer principle. It also features three mini-projects:
      1. Rock-Paper-Scissors game
      2. Quiz game
      3. Calculator for converting between number systems
