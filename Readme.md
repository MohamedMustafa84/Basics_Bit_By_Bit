# Programming Advices

This repository contains the path I followed to learn programming and its foundations in a healthy way, presented by **Dr. Muhammad Abu Hudhud**, who has more than **29 years of experience** in the field of programming and management and is the founder of the **Programming Advices** platform.

> **Note:** This repository only contains my practical solutions and projects, i.e. it does not contain courses that are presented theoretically and do not include writing codes.
