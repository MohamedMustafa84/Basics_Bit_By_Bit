# Basics_Bit_By_Bit

This repository documents my structured journey to master programming **step by step** (“Bit by Bit”) under the mentorship of **Dr. Muhammad Abu Hudhud**, founder of the [Programming Advices](https://programmingadvices.com) platform.  
Each folder represents a specific stage in my learning path — from fundamental computer concepts to real-world C++ projects.

> **Note:**  
> This repository contains **only my practical solutions and projects**.  
> It does **not** include the theoretical courses that do not involve code writing.
